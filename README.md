# MediCo.com ðŸ©º

**MediCo.com** is a web-based medical image analysis application built with **Flask**.  
It allows users to upload medical scans (such as X-rays or MRIs) and uses a machine learning model to detect possible health conditions.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project integrates a trained AI model into a Flask web app to provide **automated medical image analysis**.  
Users can upload scans through a simple web interface, and the system will process the image, run it through the ML model, and display the prediction.
